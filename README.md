# Jubatus Classification RestFul Service

We provide the Jubatus Classification Server json and the full project code of the Service.

The Problem is to decide about the type of the the values of a sensor network.
The files we handle have the "label(type)",value form in each line and contain mixed data.
All files must be in a folder named trainDat in the location of the jar.
We are not provide any data sets. 

This project uses Spring Boot version 1.4 and Jubatus version 1.0.x
